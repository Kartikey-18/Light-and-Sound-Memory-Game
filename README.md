## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
   I used the official guide provided by CodePath to build this project. The steps mentioned in the guide were elaborate and easy to understand, thanks to which I was    able to complete the project.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
   Before, I began I was worried that I would not be able to build the project as I had no idea how we write scripts and write code so that we can bring interactivity    to our website. Although, I have worked on a website in the past using basic HTML and wix, but never got the chance to work using javascript or react. Therefore, I    was concerned whether or not I would be able to complete the project, let alone on time!

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
   I highly appreciate the official guide which made the learning process easy, thanks to which I was able to overcome my problem. I did not have to go online or look    for solutions to some errors. Everything was provided in the guide itself. 
                          While working on the project, I learnt that we have three main components of a website – index.html, script.js and style.css. As I progressed    further, I got introduced to each of these components and I realised how they serve 3 different purposes. ‘CSS’ is for styling; ‘Index’ is for designing what our      website would look like; and ‘Script’ is the most fascinating part – where we write functions to bring ‘magic’ into our website. When I finished, my dilemma on how    we combine these three different elements was cleared and I felt confident in my progress!


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
   If I had a few more hours on this project, I would spend them trying to add animations to buttons and the website in general. I would make a confetti animation when the user wins and a similar one for when he/she loses. Moreover, I would try to add a leaderboard to store what the user has stored in the past.
